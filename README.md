Node Authentication

Here, we are going to use dependencies like:
bcryptjs: A library to hash passwords.,

connect:Connect is a simple framework to glue together various "middleware" to handle requests.,

ejs: embedded javascript templates,

express-ejs-layouts:layout support for ejs in express,

mongoose:Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment

passport: passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

passport-local: Local authentication is done.



Since, we are using nodejs drive , so, for mongoodb to work perfectly we have to run the command npm install monngo --save

After we define a schema, Mongoose lets us create a Model based schema.
